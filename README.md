## **Passion Projects**  

* **Iron Whale (current focus)** - A delay/echo audio FX tool with optional distortion/saturation. My first full-length audio DSP project (C++, JUCE framework).
* **Cheap Thrills (to do)** - A one-knob, black-box audio plugin designed to bring immediate attitude to drum breaks through heavy DSP. Not for producers who want fine control! (C++, JUCE framework).
* **GruntWork Pella (to do)** - A basic tool designed for music producers to simplify the search for clean vocal samples. Uses the **discogs.com** API, returning a list of acapellas that satisfy specified search filters (C++).
